For LEFT_PLACE_NEXTTO_ONTOP and RIGHT_PLACE_NEXTTO_ONTOP, the action command are in the format of {'action': 'action_name', 'object': 'obj_name1, obj_name2'}\n5. If you want to perform an action to an target object, you must make sure the target object is not inside a closed object.\n6. For actions like OPEN, CLOSE, SLICE, COOK, CLEAN, SOAK, DRY, FREEZE, UNFREEZE, TOGGLE_ON, TOGGLE_OFF, at least one of the robot's hands must be empty, and the target object must have the corresponding property like they're openable, toggleable, etc.\n7. For PLACE actions and RELEASE actions, the robot must hold an object in the corresponding hand.\n8.

the robot opens the target object, to execute the action, the target object should be openable and closed, also, toggle off the target object first if want to open it, e.g. {'action': 'OPEN', 'object': 'fridge_1'}.\nCLOSE # the robot closes the target object, to execute the action, the target object should be openable and open, e.g. {'action': 'CLOSE', 'object': 'fridge_1'}.\nCOOK # the robot cooks the target object, to execute the action, the target object should be put in a pan, e.g. {'action': 'COOK', 'object': 'apple_0'}.\nCLEAN # the robot cleans the target object, to execute the action, the robot should have a cleaning tool such as rag, the cleaning tool should be soaked if possible, or the target object should be put into a toggled on cleaner like a sink or a dishwasher, e.g. {'action': 'CLEAN', 'object': 'window_0'}.\nFREEZE # the robot freezes the target object e.g. {'action': 'FREEZE', 'object': 'apple_0'}.\nUNFREEZE # the robot unfreezes the target object, e.g. {'action': 'UNFREEZE', 'object': 'apple_0'}.\nSLICE # the robot slices the target object, to execute the action, the robot should have a knife in hand, e.g. {'action': 'SLICE', 'object': 'apple_0'}.\nSOAK #

the robot toggles on the target object, to execute the action, the target object must be closed if the target object is openable and open e.g. {'action': 'TOGGLE_ON', 'object': 'light_0'}.\nTOGGLE_OFF # the robot toggles off the target object, e.g. {'action': 'TOGGLE_OFF', 'object': 'light_0'}.\nLEFT_PLACE_NEXTTO # the robot places the object in its left hand next to the target object and release the object in its left hand, e.g. {'action': 'LEFT_PLACE_NEXTTO', 'object': 'table_1'}.\nRIGHT_PLACE_NEXTTO # the robot places the object in its right hand next to the target object and release the object in its right hand, e.g. {'action': 'RIGHT_PLACE_NEXTTO', 'object': 'table_1'}.\nLEFT_TRANSFER_CONTENTS_INSIDE # the robot transfers the contents in the object in its left hand inside the target object, e.g. {'action': 'LEFT_TRANSFER_CONTENTS_INSIDE', 'object': 'bow_1'}.\nRIGHT_TRANSFER_CONTENTS_INSIDE # the robot transfers the contents in the object in its right hand inside the target object, e.g. {'action': 'RIGHT_TRANSFER_CONTENTS_INSIDE', 'object': 'bow_1'}.\nLEFT_TRANSFER_CONTENTS_ONTOP #

The robot can only hold one object in each hand.\n2. Action name must be one of the above action names, and the object name must be one of the object names listed in the interactable objects.\n3. All PLACE actions will release the object in the robot's hand, you don't need to explicitly RELEASE the object after the PLACE action.\n4. For LEFT_PLACE_NEXTTO_ONTOP and RIGHT_PLACE_NEXTTO_ONTOP, the action command are in the format of {'action': 'action_name', 'object': 'obj_name1, obj_name2'}\n5. If you want to perform an action to an target object, you must make sure the target object is not inside a closed object.\n6. For actions like OPEN, CLOSE, SLICE, COOK, CLEAN, SOAK, DRY, FREEZE, UNFREEZE, TOGGLE_ON, TOGGLE_OFF, at least one of the robot's hands must be empty, and the target object must have the corresponding property like they're openable, toggleable, etc.\n7. For PLACE actions and RELEASE actions, the robot must hold an object in the corresponding hand.\n8. Before slicing an object, the robot can only interact with the object (e.g. peach_0), after slicing the object, the robot can only interact with the sliced object (e.g. peach_0_part_0). \n\n\nExamples: after# is the explanation.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\ninitial environment state:\n['stained', 'sink_7']\n['stained', 'bathtub_4']\n['not', 'soaked', 'rag_0']\n['onfloor', 'rag_0', 'room_floor_bathroom_0']\n['inside', 'rag_0', 'cabinet_1']\n['not', 'open', 'cabinet_1']\n\n\ntarget environment state:\n['not', 'stained', 'bathtub_4']\n['not', 'stained', 'sink_7']\n['and', 'soaked', 'rag_0', 'inside', 'rag_0', 'bucket_0']\n\n\ninteractable objects:\n{'name': 'sink_7', 'category': 'sink.n.01'}\n{'name': 'bathtub_4', 'category': 'bathtub.n.01'}\n{'name': 'bucket_0', 'category': 'bucket.n.01'}\n{'name': 'rag_0', 'category': 'rag.n.01'}\n{'name': 'cabinet_1', 'category': 'cabinet.n.01'}\n\n\nPlease output the list of action commands (in the given format) so that after the robot executes the action commands sequentially, the current environment state will change to target environment state.
